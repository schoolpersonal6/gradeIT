# Acknowledgements

- This project was developed as part of the HackBytes II 2023 hackathon.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Next.js is a powerful React framework that provides an excellent development experience for building modern web applications. It simplifies the process of creating server-rendered React applications with features like automatic code splitting, hot module replacement, and more.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that enables developers to write more robust and maintainable code. By adding static types to JavaScript, TypeScript helps catch errors during development and provides better tooling support.
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) - DaisyUI is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. It extends Tailwind CSS with additional classes and components, allowing for quick and flexible UI development.

We are grateful for the open-source contributions made by the developers behind Next.js, TypeScript, and DaisyUI, as their projects have significantly enhanced the development process of GradeAI-Frontend.
